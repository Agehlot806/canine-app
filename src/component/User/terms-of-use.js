        <p>There may be a multitude of factors due to which the services of the Platform could get disrupted any time. Canine does not in any manner guarantee uninterrupted and continuous admission to the site for reasons beyond the control of Canine.</p>
        <p>All content and data online that is on the Platform have been garnered by Canine from what's believed to be reliable and authorized sources. The matter has been furnished on an 'As is where is' basis.</p>
